# Particle simulator

## Description
This is some dumb simulator that I wrote in C. It's not at all optimised and it's not very well written but it's good enough for me and it works pretty well.

## Controls
In order to use the partical simulator you use the W key to spawn balls or S keys to destroy them. You can also invert gravity by holding down the space bar or have them move to the centre with G. 

Pressing I increases the amount of balls that spawn, Pressing K reduces it
Pressing O increases drag, pressing L reduces it

## Build instructions
I'm very new to C so I have not really included any way to build the project. If you are on linux you should be able to build it given that you have SDL3 installed and the gcc compiler using make
